Flutter works with \nexisting code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free \nand open source.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 Advantages of Flutter :  \n \n \no Dart Programming Language :  \n \nFlutter uses Dart as its primary programming language. Dart is an object  \noriented, class -based language with C -style syntax.  \nDart offers features such as strong typing, asynchronous programming, and a \nreactive programming style, making it well -suited for building modern, reactive \nuser interfaces.  \n \n \n\n \n  Page | 12 \n  \n \no Widget -based Framework:  \n \nFlutter uses a widget -based approach to building user interfaces. \nEverything in Flutter is a widget, including structural elements like buttons and \ncontainers, layout elements like rows and columns, and even entire screens.  \nWidgets are immutable and declarative, meaning that instead of changing \nthe properties of existing widgets, you create new widgets to reflect changes in the \nUI. \n  \no Hot Reload:  \n \nOne of the most powerful features of Flutter is its hot reload capability. Hot \nreload allows developers to make changes to their code and see the results \ninstantly reflected in the running app without losing the app state.  \nThis rapid iteration cycle significantly speeds up the development process \nand enables developers to experiment and iterate on UI designs quickly.  \n  \no Cross -platform Development:  \n \nFlutter enables cross -platform development, allowing developers to write \ncode once and deploy it to multiple platforms, including iOS, Android, web, and \ndesktop (Windows, macOS, Linux).  \nBy sharing a single codebase, developers can save time and effort in \nmaintaining separate codebases for different platforms.  \n \no Performance:  \n \nFlutter provides high -performance rendering using its own graphics engine \ncalled Skia. Skia is a mature, cross -platform 2D graphics library used by various \nprojects, including Google Chrome and Android.  \nFlutter's architecture allows it to achieve consistent 60 frames per second \n(fps) performance, resulting in smooth and fluid animations and interactions.  \n \no Customization and Flexibility:  \n \nFlutter offers extensive customization options, allowing developers to create \nhighly polished and visually stunning user interfaces.  \n \n  Page | 13 \n Developers can customize every aspect of their app's UI, including animations, \ntransitions, and gestures, using Flutter's rich set of built -in widgets and APIs.  \n\u2022  Features  of Flutter :  \no Easy connection of back -end and asynchronization.  \no Fast and responsive layout.  \no Superior execution application  \no Runs same UI for numerous stages.  \no Colossal gadget list.  \no Delightful and liquid UIs.  \no Quick turn of events.  \no Present day and receptive structure.  \n \nSince the launch of Flutter in May 2017, it has resolved many of the existing \nproblems in the app development industry. Flutter is a powerful technology, or we can \nsay a tool backed by Dart language packed with a powerful mobile framework that can be \nused in both iOS and Android applications. Flutter is often used with DART , which is an \nobject -oriented programming language by Google. The flutter development tools come \nwith a graphics library and material design, and the Cupertino design allows faster \noperat ions of the app and also gives the app a stunning look, irrespective of its operating \nplatform! The biggest advantage of flutter is that it can be used to create cross -platform \napps. Using flutter, one can create iOS apps, Android apps, Websites, and much cross -\nplatform software in just one go, there is no need to write code for different platforms.  \n1. iOS Apps:  \nThese apps are made for Apple devices and wear. iOS apps are made using the \nSwift language. The iOS apps have an extension of .ipa.  \n \n2. Android Apps:  \nThese apps are made for android devices and wear. Android apps are made using \nJava and Kotlin, with an extension of .apk. Many app developers who had to work in a \ncross -platform work environment, and are responsible for the development of both \nandroid and iOS apps, found it a difficult and lengthy process to develop apps for both \nplatforms. The major problems encountered by companies and developers were:  \nNo Cross -Platform Dependency: iOS and Android apps work very differently \ninternally, so the developers had to redesign and reconfigure the same content for \nindividual platforms.  \nTime Constraints: Making a professional app, from coding to designing, requires a \nlot of time. Companies usually set a time limit by which the app should be ready to be \nlaunched into the market. Those developers who had to work on both these platforms \noften found time limit issues, and the efficiency and quality of work degraded.  \n \n  Page | 14 \n More Employees: This problem was encountered by companies. Since they have to \ndevelop an app for both platforms, a greater number of app developers knowing about \nthe individual platform had to be hired.  \n \n\u2756 Back end Technology :  \n \n1 ) Firebase :  \n \nFirebase is a comprehensive mobile and web development platform provided \nby Google, offering a wide range of tools and services to help developers build \nhigh -quality apps, grow their user base, and earn revenue. Firebase provides a \nunified platform for backend services, analytics, authentication, cloud messagi ng, \nremote configuration, and more, allowing developers to focus on building great \nuser experiences without worrying about managing infrastructure or scaling their \nbackend.  \nFirebase offers a suite of backend services, including Realtime Database, Cloud \nFirestore, Cloud Functions, Authentication, Cloud Storage, and Hosting. These \nservices provide developers with scalable and reliable infrastructure for storing \ndata, managing u ser authentication, and executing server -side logic.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022  Features  of F irebase  : \no Backend Services:  \n \nFirebase offers a suite of backend services, including Realtime Database, \nCloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, Authentication, Cloud Storage, and Hosting. \nThese services provide developers with scalable and reliable infrastructure for \nstoring data, managing user authentication, and executing server -side logic.  \n \n \n\n \n  Page | 15 \n  \n \no Analytics:  \n \nFirebase Analytics provides insights into user behavior and app \nperformance, allowing developers to understand how users interact with their \napp, track user engagement, and measure key metrics such as retention, \nconversion, and revenue.  \n \no Authentication:  \n \nFirebase Authentication offers easy -to-use authentication solutions, \nincluding email/password authentication, social authentication (using providers \nlike Google, Facebook, Twitter), phone number authentication, and anonymous \nauthentication. It allows devel opers to securely authenticate users and manage \nuser identities across platforms.  \n \no Cloud Messaging:  \n \nFirebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) enables developers to send targeted \nmessages and notifications to users across platforms, including Android, iOS, and \nweb. It supports various message types, including notifications, data messages, \nand topic -based messaging, helping developers engage and r e-engage users \neffectively.  \n \no Remote Configuration:  \n \nFirebase Remote Config allows developers to remotely configure app \nsettings, feature flags, and parameters without requiring app updates. It enables \ndynamic content personalization, A/B testing, and staged rollouts, empowering \ndevelopers to optimize app ex periences based on user feedback and behavior.  \n \no Cloud Storage:  \n \nFirebase Cloud Storage provides secure and scalable cloud storage for \nstoring user -generated content such as images, videos, and files. It offers powerful \nstorage capabilities, including multi -region replication, access control, and \nintegration with Firebase Authentication.  \n \n \n  Page | 16 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2756 Cloud Firestore Database :  \n \n Cloud Firestore is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, \nweb, and server development from Firebase and Google Cloud. Like Firebase \nRealtime Database, it keeps your data in sync across client apps through realtime \nlisteners and offers offline support fo r mobile and web so you can build responsive \napps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud \nFirestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud \nproducts, including Cloud Functions.  \n  \n Cloud Firestore is newer, but it is not replacing the Firebase \nReal -time Database. Cloud Firestore is a flexible as well as scalable NoSQL cloud \ndatabase. It is used to store and sync data for client and server -side development. \nIt is used for mobile, web, and server development from Google Cloud Platform \nand Firebase. Like the  Firebase Real -time Database, it keeps syncing our data via \nreal-time listeners to the client app. It provides offline support for mobile and web \nso we can create responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or \nInternet connectivity.  Cloud Fires tore also provides seamless integration with \nGoogle Cloud Platform products and other Firebase, including cloud functions.  \n \n After Cloud Firestore's NoSQL data model, we can store data \nin documents that have field mappings for values. The documents are stored in a \ncontainer called collections. These containers are used to organize our data and \ncreate queries. There are different data types, from simple string and numbers to \ncomplex nested objects, supported by documents. We can also create sub-\ncollection within a document and create a hierarchical data structure that scales \nto the growth of our database. The Firestore data model supports whatever data \nstructure works best for our app.  \n \n\n \n  Page | 17 \n  \n\u2756 Payment Gateway Integration  : \n \n  \n1 ) Razorpay Integration in Flutter :  \n \n Razorpay is a leading payment gateway provider in India, \noffering a secure, reliable, and feature -rich platform for processing online \npayments.

An ERD uses  data \nmodeling techniques that can help define business processes and serve as the  foundation \nfor a relational database.  \n \nEntity relationship diagrams provide a visual starting point for database  design \nthat can also be used to help determine information system requirements  throughout an \norganization. After a relational database is rolled out, an ERD can still  serve as a reference \npoint, should any debugging or business process re -engineering be  needed later.  \n \nHowever, while an ERD can be useful for organizing data that can be  represented \nby a relational structure, it can't sufficiently represent semi -structured or  unstructured \ndata. It's also unlikely to be helpful on its own in integrating data into a  pre-existing \ninformation system.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Page | 42 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n

Page | 75 \n 7 \nSoftware Testing  \n \n \n Testing is the process of detecting errors. Testing performs a very \ncritical role for  the quality assurance and for ensuring the reliability of software. The \nresults of testing  are used later on during maintenance also.  \n \n Software testing is a critical element of software quality \nassurances and represents  the ultimate review of specification, design and coding. Testing \nis an exposure of a  system to trial input to see whether it produces correct output. Testing \ncannot be  determined whether software meets user\u2019s needs, only whether it appears to \nconfirm to  requirements. Testing can show that a system is free of errors, only that it \ncontains  error. Testing finds errors, it does not correct errors. Software success is a quality  \nproduct, on time and within cost. Though testing can reveal critical (costly) mistakes.  \nTesting should therefore,  \n \n\u27a2 Validate Performance  \n\u27a2 Detect Errors  \n\u27a2 Identify Inconsistencies  \n \n \n\u2756 What is Testing ?  \n \n\u27a2 Testing is the process of examining an application to ensure it fulfils the  \nrequirements for which it was designed and meets quality expectations.  \n\u27a2 More importantly, testing ensure the application meet customer expectations.  \n\u27a2 Testing accomplished a verity of things but most importantly it measures the  \nquality of websites you are developing.  \n\u27a2 This view presupposes there are defect in your website waiting to be  discovered \nand this view is rarely disproved or even disputed.  \n \n \n \n  Page | 76 \n \u2756 Testing Principles  \n \n\u27a2 All the test should meet the customer requirements  \n\u27a2 To make our software testing should be performed by a third party.  \n\u27a2 Exhaustive testing is not possible. As we need the optimal amount of testing  based \non the risk assessment of the application.  \n\u27a2 All the test to be conducted should be planned before implementing it.  \n\u27a2 It follows the Pareto rule(80/20 rule) which states that 80% of errors come  from \n20% of program components.  \n\u27a2 Start testing with small parts and extend it to large parts.  \n \n\u2756 Strategy of Testing  \n \n\u27a2 Unit Testing :  \n It focuses on smallest unit of software design. In this we test an  \nindividual unit or group of inter related units. It is often done by programmer  by \nusing sample input and observing its corresponding outputs.  \n \n \n\u27a2 Integration Testing  :  \n The objective is to take unit tested components and build a  \nprogram  structure that has been dictated by design. Integration testing is testing \nin which a group of components are combined to produce output.  Integration \ntesting is of four types:  \n(i) Top down  \n(ii) Bottom up  \n(iii) Sandwich  \n(iv) Big-Bang.  \n \n\u27a2 Regression  Testing :  \n Every time new module is added leads to changes in program. This  \ntype of testing makes sure that whole component works properly even after  \nadding components to the complete program.  \n \n\u27a2 Alpha  Testing :  \n This is a type of validation testing. It is a type of acceptance testing  \nwhich is done before the product is released to customers. It is typically done  by \nQA people.  \n  \n \n  Page | 77 \n \u27a2 Beta  Testing :  \n The beta test is conducted at one or more customer sites by the  \nenduser of the software. This version is released for the limited number of users  \nfor testing in real time environment . \n \n\u27a2 System  Testing :  \n In this software is tested such that it works fine for different  \noperating system. It is covered under the black box testing technique. In this  we \njust focus on required input and output without focusing on internal  working. In \nthis we have security testing, recovery testing, stress testing and  performance \ntesting.  \n \n\u27a2 Performance  Testing :  \n It is designed to test the run -time performance of software within  \nthe context of an integrated system. It is used to test speed and effectiveness  of \nprogram.  \n \n \n\u2756 Purpose of Testing  \n \n\u27a2 Identify defects or bugs in the software.  \n\u27a2 Ensure the software meets functional and non -functional requirements.  \n\u27a2 Validate that the software performs as expected under various conditions.  \n\u27a2 Enhance the quality, reliability, and usability of the software.  \n\u27a2 Verify compliance with regulatory standards and industry best practices.  \n \n \n\u2756 Software Testing Process  \n \n\u27a2 Test Planning:  \nDefine test objectives, scope, resources, and timelines.
